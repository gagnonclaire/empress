The standard setting for Valiance is Archaea, and ancient seascape dotted with living continents and titanic primordial beings. Recently, it has also become the home of the Archaean people.

## 1.2  The World

Valiance is set on the barrier: a vast ocean dotted with small continents that are home to all manner of mundane and fantastical beings. The barrier is the home of the Archians, a wildly varied peoples that thrive in this unpredictable, dangerous world. Among these Archians exist our valiants. While not terribly numerous, they are undeniably a political, economic, and sometimes social force on the barrier. The valiants that survive their deadly profession are granted wealth beyond their wildest dreams, in return for a few brief stints of unconditional servitude.

### Cruel Circumstances

The geopolitics of the world are driven chiefly by a severe lack of resources, an obvious consequence of a world consisting almost entirely of vast oceans. This lack of resources almost always leads to material inequalities, and for many people there is little hope of societal mobility because of this. Most individuals turn to valiancy as an escape from this fate. They risk their lives on behalf of the wealthy elite in a desperate attempt to pull themselves from a life of thankless labor. Most of them, unfortunately, die long before they achieve that goal.

#### A Global Currency

Across the sea, there is no coin more recognizable than the Brineflame Tin, “ƭ”. This coin, originally minted from a soft gray alloy, spread far across the seas. Now,, nearly every civilization on the barrier recognizes it as a standard currency.

Tin are not backed by any sort of commodity and are accepted by most people purely as a tool of commerce. In modern days are represented most commonly by paper bills or entries in ledgers.

There are other local currencies across the seas, but their value is almost always relative to the standard Tin. Even societies that don’t use currency internally, such as Sunspire, use Tin as a standard for international trade.

#### Bloody Enticement

In developed regions, the median net income is around ƭ40,000, enough to afford a modest living in an urban center. With seasonal rent averaging ƭ5,000, and a budget meal costing a few Tin a piece, most people have little to no savings and live anxiously from season to season.

The lackluster standard of living is enough to placate the common person, but certain bold and desperate individuals turn to valiancy. The work is deadly, but even novices in the field are promised tens of thousands of Tin for a single contract.

  

### Your Place in it All

The world of the barrier is a lucrative one for valiants. Having several thousand years of history behind them, Archians have succeeded in building systems and societies that are relatively advanced and complex. Creature comforts such as radio and early form of broadcasted video keep the masses content, while advancements in rail locomotion and intercontinental flight allow for expanded commerce. And the world’s national militaries, always vying for supremacy, experiment in remote black sites, developing armaments that will inevitably find their way onto the gray market.

#### In Good Company

In the middle of all of the world’s many races are our valiants. Individually, they rarely have any sort of personal stake in whatever grand plan their client is enacting. For them, the goal is to simply do their job and get paid, incurring as little physical and emotional trauma in the process.

Almost universally, valiants belong to a company. These companies can range from proper corporations in and of themselves, to barebones operations consisting only of the actual valiants. It’s exceedingly rare for valiants to operate independently, as in this line of work knowing your team can make the difference between a paycheck to bring home and being buried in an unmarked grave in a foreign land.

For valiants, a paycheck is much more than a few seasons worth of bills. Acquiring the tools and equipment needed to succeed in the field is no easy task. Valiants spend exorbitant sums of Tin to track down and acquire exotic gear from international gray markets. Without substantial corporate backing, much of a valiant’s pay is reinvested in an attempt to get them through one more job.

#### A Valiant Career

Valiants’ contracts may send them anywhere from highland vistas to cruel wind-scarred wastes, or from ancient ruins of bygone civilizations to dense urban environments glowing with arcane signage. As dangerous as valiancy on the barrier can be, it is an extremely rewarding profession. Many valiants take only one or two contracts a year, taking long vacations between intense bursts of life-or-death conflict. After surviving only a few years of this, most valiants can afford to retire. Even so, good valiants tend not to be lazy people, and many work and live as regular folk between jobs, or even after retirement.

In Valiance, it’s common for a story to begin with a group of aspirants – people aspiring to valiancy – and end with the retirement of an accomplished company of valiants. However, stories can begin and end in many ways. Groups may decide to begin their story with an already established company of valiants or end their valiants’ stories (tragically or otherwise) before their retirement.

### A Land Between

There exist realms above and below the barrier. These spaces, the cosmos and the deep, are the realms of order and chaos, respectively. While neither is necessarily good or bad, they both exert their constant influences upon the barrier.

#### From a Valiant’s Perspective

To a valiant, the exact cosmological nature of their world isn’t terribly relevant. What is relevant, however, is the danger that both chaos and order can impose when gone unchecked. When not engaging in the regular corporate sabotage, many valiants find themselves protecting remote communities from all manner of existential threats.

  

### Languages

There are two primary types of languages on the barrier: lineage languages and common tongues.

Lineage languages were devised by the first tribes seeded upon the barrier. Descendants of these tribes carried their customs and languages throughout the barrier as tribes grew, split, and migrated to distant lands. While these cultures and languages mutated and evolved in subtle ways, speakers of lineage languages are almost always able to communicate across dialects.

The common tongues are simplified amalgamations of the lineage languages found in various regions, and as such tend to be similar to one-another. Characters in regions where they do not speak the common language are often still able to coarsely communicate using their own common language.

#### Inherent Languages

Almost all characters know the languages of their dominant lineage(s) and the common tongue of their home region.

#### Telepathy

Not all characters rely on spoken languages. The original denizens of the realms (cosmic beings, dregs, and primordials) rely on telepathic communications. Telepathy, put simply, is communication via arcane transmissions. Nearly every living creature on the barrier is able to receive telepathic messages, though their ability to parse them is dependent on their intelligence.

In order to send telepathic messages, Archians require arcane training. The ability to convey raw thoughts and emotions is achievable with minimal training but is not practically useful. To send more structured messages, significant training and understanding of arcane fundamentals are required.
